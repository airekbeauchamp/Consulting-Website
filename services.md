<h2>The Opportunity Everyone Misses</h2>

<p>You're doing something that matters because you see what's missing. Maybe you're the architect who notices how morning light changes spaces in ways your clients haven't imagined yet. Or the pizzeria owner who knows that perfect fermentation creates flavors most people have never tasted.</p>

<p>That gap between what you see and what others understand isn't a communication problem—it's your biggest opportunity. You're already contributing something essential to your community, your field, your people. Now we just need to help others see what you see.</p>

<h2>Content Strategy & Voice Development</h2>
<p><em>For people who are filling gaps others haven't noticed yet</em></p>

<h3>What This Really Means</h3>
<p>You see something specific that needs to exist—like the architect who knows exactly how afternoon light will make your reading nook feel like a sanctuary, or the baker who understands why a 72-hour cold ferment creates flavors that make people pause mid-bite. That specificity is your contribution. I help you share it so others can see what you see.</p>

<h3>What We Actually Do</h3>

<h4>Uncover Your Contribution</h4>
<p>We dig into the gap you're filling—not through some "expertise audit" but through real conversation about what lights you up. What do you notice that others miss? What problems do you solve that nobody else even sees? That's where your voice lives.</p>

<h4>Make Your Voice Carry</h4>
<ul>
<li>LinkedIn posts that share your specific insights (not "5 tips for success")</li>
<li>Newsletters that feel like getting coffee with someone who knows their stuff</li>
<li>Speaking topics you're excited to explore, not just deliver</li>
<li>Website copy that makes people say "finally, someone who gets it"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Build Systems That Last</h4>
<ul>
<li>Templates that sound like you on a good day</li>
<li>Editorial calendars based on what you know, not what's trending</li>
<li>Ways to help your team maintain your voice without losing their own</li>
<li>Evolution based on what resonates, not what some metric says should work</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who This Is For</h3>
<p>People who've built real expertise by paying attention to what's missing. You're contributing something specific—maybe you're the therapist who noticed traditional approaches weren't working for creative professionals, or the accountant who saw small businesses drowning in advice meant for corporations. You know generic content isn't working because it doesn't capture what you uniquely see.</p>

<p><strong>Investment:</strong> Starting at $5,000 to build your foundation. We figure out ongoing support based on what you need.</p>

<h2>Grant Writing & Funding Strategy</h2>
<p><em>For people whose good ideas need money to happen</em></p>

<h3>What This Really Means</h3>
<p>You know that thing you're building that could change how your field works? The program that would help hundreds of kids learn differently, or the research that could shift how we think about sustainable farming? It deserves funding. I translate your vision into the language funders speak, without losing what makes it yours.</p>

<h3>What We Actually Do</h3>

<h4>Find the Right Funders</h4>
<p>Not just whoever's giving away money, but the ones who care about your specific gap. That NSF officer who's been waiting for someone to tackle STEM writing differently. The foundation board member whose kid struggled with exactly what your program addresses. We find the alignment between what you see and what they're hoping to fund.</p>

<h4>Write the Story They Need to Hear</h4>
<ul>
<li>Narratives that show why your approach fills a real gap</li>
<li>Budgets that prove you've thought through the Tuesday afternoon details</li>
<li>Evaluation plans that show you know what success looks like (not just what sounds good)</li>
<li>Multiple drafts because clarity takes time (I've never nailed it on the first try)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Navigate the Process</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of deadlines so you can focus on your work</li>
<li>Build relationships for next time (because there's always a next time)</li>
<li>Learn from rejections—they're information, not verdicts</li>
<li>Resubmit smarter when it makes sense</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Numbers Tell Stories</h3>
<p>$365,668 secured, including $350K from NSF to teach STEM students to write like scientists who can explain things. Not because I know secret grant codes, but because I help funders see what you see: the gap that needs filling and why you're the one to fill it.</p>

<h3>Who This Is For</h3>
<p>People with programs that matter who need resources to make them real. Especially good for those who've heard "we loved your idea but..." because the proposal didn't capture what makes your approach essential.</p>

<p><strong>Investment:</strong> Starting at $3,500 for smaller grants (under $50K). Larger grants typically 3-5% of requested amount—because aligning your vision with funder priorities takes real work.</p>

<h2>Communication Ecosystems</h2>
<p><em>For people whose content is working against itself</em></p>

<h3>What This Really Means</h3>
<p>Right now, your LinkedIn posts say one thing, your newsletter says another, and your website might as well be about someone else entirely. That's not because you're inconsistent—it's because nobody helped you see how it all connects. Like the nutritionist whose Instagram shares quick tips while their blog posts contradict their booking page. Everything you create should build on everything else.</p>

<h3>What We Actually Do</h3>

<h4>Connect the Dots</h4>
<p>We map out how the thing you know shows up everywhere. Your story about learning to repair vintage guitars becomes a LinkedIn post about craftsmanship, a newsletter about patience in learning, and a service page about teaching attention to detail. Same expertise, different angles, all reinforcing why you're the one to learn from.</p>

<h4>Keep Your Voice Consistent</h4>
<ul>
<li>Build a "voice blueprint" that captures how you naturally communicate</li>
<li>Document your go-to examples and explanations</li>
<li>Create guidelines your team can follow without sounding robotic</li>
<li>Maintain your personality across everything, even when others help write</li>
</ul>

<h4>Make Each Platform Work With the Others</h4>
<ul>
<li>LinkedIn that shares your specific insights (and brings people to your deeper work)</li>
<li>Newsletters that feel like continued conversations, not random broadcasts</li>
<li>Speaking topics that emerge from what you're already exploring</li>
<li>Websites that feel like the<h4>Make Your Ideas Clearer</h4>
<p>I left my red pen in the Ivory Tower. I'm not here to police your grammar. We're finding the story in your data, the thread that connects your insights, the examples that make people lean in. Like helping the structural engineer explain seismic retrofitting through the story of a family business that stayed standing, while still maintaining the technical credibility that makes other engineers trust you. You need both languages, and both need to sound like you.</p>

<h4>Polish Without Sanitizing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Edit line by line while keeping your personality intact</li>
<li>Make sure your Tuesday blog post doesn't contradict your Thursday keynote</li>
<li>Check facts without losing the narrative</li>
<li>Fix grammar without making you sound like a textbook</li>
</ul>

<h4>Write It From Scratch (In Your Voice)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Proposals that get funded because they show the gap you're filling ($365K+ track record)</li>
<li>Website copy that sounds like you explaining your work over coffee</li>
<li>Materials that showcase what you specifically bring to the table</li>
<li>Grants that tell your story while hitting all the requirements</li>
<li>Newsletters that share real insights, not recycled tips</li>
</ul>

<h4>Make It Look Like What It Is</h4>
<ul>
<li>Design that supports your message, not overshadows it</li>
<li>Layouts that help people understand complex ideas</li>
<li>Visuals that maintain your voice even without words</li>
<li>Presentations that enhance your expertise, not distract from it</li>
</ul>

<h3>Background That Matters</h3>
<p>Lead editor on the Pack Prints textbook series—I know how to manage complex ideas from messy first draft to polished final product. PhD work taught me how communication works; consulting taught me how to make it work for you.</p>

<h3>Who This Is For</h3>
<p>People who have important things to say and want help saying them clearly. The researcher whose findings could change practices but can't escape academic speak. The consultant who knows exactly what clients need but struggles to articulate it. You understand the difference between sounding impressive and being understood.</p>

<p><strong>Investment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Editing: $75-125/hour (depends on how tangled we're starting)</li>
<li>Writing from scratch: From $1,500 (web copy) to $2,500 (proposals)</li>
<li>Design work: Starting at $1,200 for complete visual identity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Training & Documentation</h2>
<p><em>For people who can't be everywhere at once</em></p>

<h3>What This Really Means</h3>
<p>You know that thing you do naturally—like how you always explain the budget implications before diving into technical details, or how you can tell within two emails if a client's going to be difficult? Your team needs to know these things too. Not through osmosis or hoping they figure it out, but through systems that capture how you really work.</p>

<h3>What We Actually Do</h3>

<h4>Help Your Team Sound Like Your Team</h4>
<ul>
<li>Capture how you naturally explain things (not how you think you should)</li>
<li>Document the examples that work every time</li>
<li>Create workflows based on what you really do, not what the manual says</li>
<li>Build training that sticks because it's based on real situations</li>
</ul>

<p>Like the architecture firm where everyone knew the principal always started with "how do you want to feel in this space?" We turned that intuition into a process everyone could follow while still sounding human.</p>

<h4>Make Client Communication Consistent</h4>
<ul>
<li>Map out how you naturally onboard clients (including the unofficial stuff)</li>
<li>Create ways to keep clients informed without 47 update emails</li>
<li>Build in feedback loops that people will really use</li>
<li>Develop the "maintaining relationships" stuff that usually lives in someone's head</li>
</ul>

<h4>Build Systems That Don't Need You</h4>
<ul>
<li>Document the daily afternoon decisions, not just the big ones</li>
<li>Create quality checks based on what really matters</li>
<li>Design training that develops judgment, not just skills</li>
<li>Build in ways to get better based on what's really happening</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why I Can Do This</h3>
<p>Seven years building writing centers that helped thousands of students meant creating systems that worked whether I was there or not. Managing 15+ tutors taught me that good documentation isn't about control—it's about helping people succeed when you're not in the room.</p>

<h3>Who This Is For</h3>
<p>People whose businesses are outgrowing the "just ask me" phase. The consultant who's tired of being the only one who can write proposals. The design studio where new hires take forever to "get" the house style. You want growth without losing what makes you special.</p>

<p><strong>Investment:</strong> Starting at $4,500 for foundation documentation and training design. Implementation help based on what you need.</p>

<h2>How We Work Together</h2>

<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>We start by figuring out what makes your expertise yours. Not through some generic questionnaire, but through real conversation about the gap you're filling. Like sitting down with the baker who realized everyone was teaching recipes but nobody was teaching how to read dough. We find your version of reading dough.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>I build systems around how you really work. Not how some business book says you should work, but how you explain things when you're excited, how you organize when you're in flow, what you do when everything's clicking. The sustainable stuff that matches your actual life.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Ideas without action are just expensive coffee conversations. We put systems in place, test them with real work, adjust based on what happens. Because the best process is the one that survives your busiest week.</p>

<h3>Evolution</h3>
<p>Your business changes. Your expertise deepens. Your audience grows. The systems we build grow with you, getting refined based on what you learn and what your clients teach you.</p>

<h2>Ready to Make Some Noise?</h2>

<p>Most communication consulting feels generic because it is generic. I work with people who have real expertise filling real gaps. People who see what's missing and want to help others see it too.</p>

<p>If you're tired of content that could be selling anything, let's talk about building communication around the specific thing you know. The gap you see. The contribution you're making.</p>

<h3>What Happens Next:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Send me an email about what you're building (or want to build)</li>
<li>We'll have a real conversation about where you're stuck</li>
<li>You'll get a proposal based on your specific situation</li>
<li>We'll start with whatever's keeping you up at night</li>
</ul>

<p>No strategy calls. No templates. Just two people talking about how to help your expertise reach the people who need it.</p>
