            <h3>The Opportunity Everyone Misses</h3>
            <p>You're doing something that matters because you see what's missing. Maybe you're the architect who notices how morning light changes spaces in ways your clients haven't imagined yet. Or the pizzeria owner who knows that perfect fermentation creates flavors most people have never tasted.</p>
            
            <p>That gap between what you see and what others understand isn't a communication problem—it's your biggest opportunity. You're already contributing something essential to your community, your field, your people. Now we just need to help others see what you see.</p>

        Content Strategy & Voice Development
For people who are filling gaps others haven't noticed yet
What This Really Means
You see something specific that needs to exist—like the architect who knows exactly how afternoon light will make your reading nook feel like a sanctuary, or the baker who understands why a 72-hour cold ferment creates flavors that make people pause mid-bite. That specificity is your contribution. I help you share it so others can see what you see.
What We Actually Do
Uncover Your Contribution
 We dig into the gap you're filling—not through some "expertise audit" but through real conversation about what lights you up. What do you notice that others miss? What problems do you solve that nobody else even sees? That's where your voice lives.
Make Your Voice Carry
LinkedIn posts that share your specific insights (not "5 tips for success")
Newsletters that feel like getting coffee with someone who knows their stuff
Speaking topics you're excited to explore, not just deliver
Website copy that makes people say "finally, someone who gets it"
Build Systems That Last
Templates that sound like you on a good day
Editorial calendars based on what you know, not what's trending
Ways to help your team maintain your voice without losing their own
Evolution based on what resonates, not what some metric says should work
Who This Is For
People who've built real expertise by paying attention to what's missing. You're contributing something specific—maybe you're the therapist who noticed traditional approaches weren't working for creative professionals, or the accountant who saw small businesses drowning in advice meant for corporations. You know generic content isn't working because it doesn't capture what you uniquely see.
Investment: Starting at $5,000 to build your foundation. We figure out ongoing support based on what you need.

Grant Writing & Funding Strategy
For people whose good ideas need money to happen
What This Really Means
You know that thing you're building that could change how your field works? The program that would help hundreds of kids learn differently, or the research that could shift how we think about sustainable farming? It deserves funding. I translate your vision into the language funders speak, without losing what makes it yours.
What We Actually Do
Find the Right Funders
 Not just whoever's giving away money, but the ones who care about your specific gap. That NSF officer who's been waiting for someone to tackle STEM writing differently. The foundation board member whose kid struggled with exactly what your program addresses. We find the alignment between what you see and what they're hoping to fund.
Write the Story They Need to Hear
Narratives that show why your approach fills a real gap
Budgets that prove you've thought through the Tuesday afternoon details
Evaluation plans that show you know what success looks like (not just what sounds good)
Multiple drafts because clarity takes time (I've never nailed it on the first try)
Navigate the Process
Keep track of deadlines so you can focus on your work
Build relationships for next time (because there's always a next time)
Learn from rejections—they're information, not verdicts
Resubmit smarter when it makes sense
The Numbers Tell Stories
$365,668 secured, including $350K from NSF to teach STEM students to write like scientists who can explain things. Not because I know secret grant codes, but because I help funders see what you see: the gap that needs filling and why you're the one to fill it.
Who This Is For
People with programs that matter who need resources to make them real. Especially good for those who've heard "we loved your idea but..." because the proposal didn't capture what makes your approach essential.
Investment: Starting at $3,500 for smaller grants (under $50K). Larger grants typically 3-5% of requested amount—because aligning your vision with funder priorities takes real work.

Communication Ecosystems
For people whose content is working against itself
What This Really Means
Right now, your LinkedIn posts say one thing, your newsletter says another, and your website might as well be about someone else entirely. That's not because you're inconsistent—it's because nobody helped you see how it all connects. Like the nutritionist whose Instagram shares quick tips while their blog posts contradict their booking page. Everything you create should build on everything else.
What We Actually Do
Connect the Dots
 We map out how the thing you know shows up everywhere. Your story about learning to repair vintage guitars becomes a LinkedIn post about craftsmanship, a newsletter about patience in learning, and a service page about teaching attention to detail. Same expertise, different angles, all reinforcing why you're the one to learn from.
Keep Your Voice Consistent
Build a "voice blueprint" that captures how you naturally communicate
Document your go-to examples and explanations
Create guidelines your team can follow without sounding robotic
Maintain your personality across everything, even when others help write
Make Each Platform Work With the Others
LinkedIn that shares your specific insights (and brings people to your deeper work)
Newsletters that feel like continued conversations, not random broadcasts
Speaking topics that emerge from what you're already exploring
Websites that feel like the natural home for everything else you share
Pay Attention to What Matters
Track whether people are hiring you, not just liking your posts
Notice which stories resonate and build from there
Listen to what your audience tells you they need
Adjust based on what's working in your actual business
Real Story
300% growth in digital engagement happened when we stopped treating each platform like its own island. A writing center that connected their workshop topics to their blog posts to their consultation offerings. Everything supported everything else. Students found them through one door and discovered five others.
Who This Is For
People who create good content but feel like they're starting from scratch every time. You know your expertise connects—the beekeeper who understands systems thinking, the designer who sees accessibility everywhere—but your content doesn't show those connections yet.
Investment: Starting at $7,500 to design how everything works together. We build ongoing support based on what helps you most.

Editing & Content Creation
For people who know their stuff but need help getting it on the page
What This Really Means
Sometimes you know exactly what you want to say—like the engineer who can explain why that bridge design is revolutionary to other engineers AND make city council members see why it matters to their constituents. You're not boring; you're bilingual, switching between technical precision and human story. But sometimes those languages get tangled on the page. Other times you need someone to write it from scratch while keeping it in your voice. Either way, I help your expertise shine through to the right audience.
What We Actually Do
Make Your Ideas Clearer
 I left my red pen in the Ivory Tower. I'm not here to police your grammar. We're finding the story in your data, the thread that connects your insights, the examples that make people lean in. Like helping the structural engineer explain seismic retrofitting through the story of a family business that stayed standing, while still maintaining the technical credibility that makes other engineers trust you. You need both languages, and both need to sound like you.
Polish Without Sanitizing
Edit line by line while keeping your personality intact
Make sure your Tuesday blog post doesn't contradict your Thursday keynote
Check facts without losing the narrative
Fix grammar without making you sound like a textbook
Write It From Scratch (In Your Voice)
Proposals that get funded because they show the gap you're filling ($365K+ track record)
Website copy that sounds like you explaining your work over coffee
Materials that showcase what you specifically bring to the table
Grants that tell your story while hitting all the requirements
Newsletters that share real insights, not recycled tips
Make It Look Like What It Is
Design that supports your message, not overshadows it
Layouts that help people understand complex ideas
Visuals that maintain your voice even without words
Presentations that enhance your expertise, not distract from it
Background That Matters
Lead editor on the Pack Prints textbook series—I know how to manage complex ideas from messy first draft to polished final product. PhD work taught me how communication works; consulting taught me how to make it work for you.
Who This Is For
People who have important things to say and want help saying them clearly. The researcher whose findings could change practices but can't escape academic speak. The consultant who knows exactly what clients need but struggles to articulate it. You understand the difference between sounding impressive and being understood.
Investment:
Editing: $75-125/hour (depends on how tangled we're starting)
Writing from scratch: From $1,500 (web copy) to $2,500 (proposals)
Design work: Starting at $1,200 for complete visual identity

Training & Documentation
For people who can't be everywhere at once
What This Really Means
You know that thing you do naturally—like how you always explain the budget implications before diving into technical details, or how you can tell within two emails if a client's going to be difficult? Your team needs to know these things too. Not through osmosis or hoping they figure it out, but through systems that capture how you really work.
What We Actually Do
Help Your Team Sound Like Your Team
Capture how you naturally explain things (not how you think you should)
Document the examples that work every time
Create workflows based on what you really do, not what the manual says
Build training that sticks because it's based on real situations
Like the architecture firm where everyone knew the principal always started with "how do you want to feel in this space?" We turned that intuition into a process everyone could follow while still sounding human.
Make Client Communication Consistent
Map out how you naturally onboard clients (including the unofficial stuff)
Create ways to keep clients informed without 47 update emails
Build in feedback loops that people will really use
Develop the "maintaining relationships" stuff that usually lives in someone's head
Build Systems That Don't Need You
Document the daily afternoon decisions, not just the big ones
Create quality checks based on what really matters
Design training that develops judgment, not just skills
Build in ways to get better based on what's really happening
Why I Can Do This
Seven years building writing centers that helped thousands of students meant creating systems that worked whether I was there or not. Managing 15+ tutors taught me that good documentation isn't about control—it's about helping people succeed when you're not in the room.
Who This Is For
People whose businesses are outgrowing the "just ask me" phase. The consultant who's tired of being the only one who can write proposals. The design studio where new hires take forever to "get" the house style. You want growth without losing what makes you special.
Investment: Starting at $4,500 for foundation documentation and training design. Implementation help based on what you need.

How We Work Together
Discovery
We start by figuring out what makes your expertise yours. Not through some generic questionnaire, but through real conversation about the gap you're filling. Like sitting down with the baker who realized everyone was teaching recipes but nobody was teaching how to read dough. We find your version of reading dough.
Development
I build systems around how you really work. Not how some business book says you should work, but how you explain things when you're excited, how you organize when you're in flow, what you do when everything's clicking. The sustainable stuff that matches your actual life.
Implementation
Ideas without action are just expensive coffee conversations. We put systems in place, test them with real work, adjust based on what happens. Because the best process is the one that survives your busiest week.
Evolution
Your business changes. Your expertise deepens. Your audience grows. The systems we build grow with you, getting refined based on what you learn and what your clients teach you.

Ready to Make Some Noise?
Most communication consulting feels generic because it is generic. I work with people who have real expertise filling real gaps. People who see what's missing and want to help others see it too.
If you're tired of content that could be selling anything, let's talk about building communication around the specific thing you know. The gap you see. The contribution you're making.
What Happens Next:
Send me an email about what you're building (or want to build)
We'll have a real conversation about where you're stuck
You'll get a proposal based on your specific situation
We'll start with whatever's keeping you up at night
No strategy calls. No templates. Just two people talking about how to help your expertise reach the people who need it.
