<h1>Services for People Who Make Things</h1>

<h2>The Opportunity Everyone Misses</h2>

<p>You're doing something that matters because you see what's missing. Maybe you're the architect who notices how morning light changes spaces in ways your clients haven't imagined yet. Or the pizzeria owner who knows that perfect fermentation creates flavors most people have never tasted.</p>

<p>That gap between what you see and what others understand isn't a communication problem—it's your biggest opportunity. You're already contributing something essential to your community, your field, your people. Now we just need to help others see what you see.</p>

<h2>Content Strategy & Voice Development</h2>
<p><em>For people who are filling gaps others haven't noticed yet</em></p>

<h3>What This Really Means</h3>
<p>You see something specific that needs to exist—like the architect who knows exactly how afternoon light will make your reading nook feel like a sanctuary, or the baker who understands why a 72-hour cold ferment creates flavors that make people pause mid-bite. That specificity is your contribution. I help you share it so others can see what you see.</p>

<h3>What We Actually Do</h3>

<h4>Uncover Your Contribution</h4>
<p>We dig into the gap you're filling—not through some "expertise audit" but through real conversation about what lights you up. What do you notice that others miss? What problems do you solve that nobody else even sees? That's where your voice lives.</p>

<h4>Make Your Voice Carry</h4>
<ul>
<li>LinkedIn posts that share your specific insights (not "5 tips for success")</li>
<li>Newsletters that feel like getting coffee with someone who knows their stuff</li>
<li>Speaking topics you're excited to explore, not just deliver</li>
<li>Website copy that makes people say "finally, someone who gets it"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Build Systems That Last</h4>
<ul>
<li>Templates that sound like you on a good day</li>
<li>Editorial calendars based on what you know, not what's trending</li>
<li>Ways to help your team maintain your voice without losing their own</li>
<li>Evolution based on what resonates, not what some metric says should work</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who This Is For</h3>
<p>People who've built real expertise by paying attention to what's missing. You're contributing something specific—maybe you're the therapist who noticed traditional approaches weren't working for creative professionals, or the accountant who saw small businesses drowning in advice meant for corporations. You know generic content isn't working because it doesn't capture what you uniquely see.</p>

<p><strong>Investment:</strong> Starting at $5,000 to build your foundation. We figure out ongoing support based on what you need.</p>

<h2>Grant Writing & Funding Strategy</h2>
<p><em>For people whose good ideas need money to happen</em></p>

<h3>What This Really Means</h3>
<p>You know that thing you're building that could change how your field works? The program that would help hundreds of kids learn differently, or the research that could shift how we think about sustainable farming? It deserves funding. I translate your vision into the language funders speak, without losing what makes it yours.</p>

<h3>What We Actually Do</h3>

<h4>Find the Right Funders</h4>
<p>Not just whoever's giving away money, but the ones who care about your specific gap. That NSF officer who's been waiting for someone to tackle STEM writing differently. The foundation board member whose kid struggled with exactly what your program addresses. We find the alignment between what you see and what they're hoping to fund.</p>

<h4>Write the Story They Need to Hear</h4>
<ul>
<li>Narratives that show why your approach fills a real gap</li>
<li>Budgets that prove you've thought through the Tuesday afternoon details</li>
<li>Evaluation plans that show you know what success looks like (not just what sounds good)</li>
<li>Multiple drafts because clarity takes time (I've never nailed it on the first try)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Navigate the Process</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of deadlines so you can focus on your work</li>
<li>Build relationships for next time (because there's always a next time)</li>
<li>Learn from rejections—they're information, not verdicts</li>
<li>Resubmit smarter when it makes sense</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Numbers Tell Stories</h3>
<p>$365,668 secured, including $350K from NSF to teach STEM students to write like scientists who can explain things. Not because I know secret grant codes, but because I help funders see what you see: the gap that needs filling and why you're the one to fill it.</p>

<h3>Who This Is For</h3>
<p>People with programs that matter who need resources to make them real. Especially good for those who've heard "we loved your idea but..." because the proposal didn't capture what makes your approach essential.</p>

<p><strong>Investment:</strong> Starting at $3,500 for smaller grants (under $50K). Larger grants typically 3-5% of requested amount—because aligning your vision with funder priorities takes real work.</p>

<h2>Communication Ecosystems</h2>
<p><em>For people whose content is working against itself</em></p>

<h3>What This Really Means</h3>
<p>Right now, your LinkedIn posts say one thing, your newsletter says another, and your website might as well be about someone else entirely. That's not because you're inconsistent—it's because nobody helped you see how it all connects. Like the nutritionist whose Instagram shares quick tips while their blog posts contradict their booking page. Everything you create should build on everything else.</p>

<h3>What We Actually Do</h3>

<h4>Connect the Dots</h4>
<p>We map out how the thing you know shows up everywhere. Your story about learning to repair vintage guitars becomes a LinkedIn post about craftsmanship, a newsletter about patience in learning, and a service page about teaching attention to detail. Same expertise, different angles, all reinforcing why you're the one to learn from.</p>

<h4>Keep Your Voice Consistent</h4>
<ul>
<li>Build a "voice blueprint" that captures how you naturally communicate</li>
<li>Document your go-to examples and explanations</li>
<li>Create guidelines your team can follow without sounding robotic</li>
<li>Maintain your personality across everything, even when others help write</li>
</ul>

<h4>Make Each Platform Work With the Others</h4>
<ul>
<li>LinkedIn that shares your specific insights (and brings people to your deeper work)</li>
<li>Newsletters that feel like continued conversations, not random broadcasts</li>
<li>Speaking topics that emerge from what you're already exploring</li>
<li>Websites that feel like the
