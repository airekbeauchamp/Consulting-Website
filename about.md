The Scholar-Practitioner Who Actually Gets Results
Most communication consultants have academic theory with no real-world application, or business experience with no intellectual depth. I bring both: a PhD in the study of how people actually communicate, plus seven years of building and scaling programs that deliver measurable outcomes.
After completing my doctorate in writing studies and sound studies at SUNY Binghamton in 2016, I spent seven years as Assistant Professor and Director of Writing Support Innovations at Arkansas State University. During this time, I applied communication theory at scale, building programs that delivered measurable outcomes. I secured $365,668 in competitive funding (including a $350,000 NSF grant) by understanding what funders actually want to see versus what academics think they want to hear. I grew online programs by 300% in their first year by building systems that worked at scale, not just on paper.
Why Academic Training Matters in Business Communication
My scholarly work examines how marginalized communities use voice and sound to navigate systems, claim authority, and resist being ignored. This isn't abstract theory—it's directly applicable intelligence about how authentic communication cuts through noise and commands attention.
As Editor-at-large for Sounding Out! (2017-2023), I helped shape national conversations around identity and voice while building inclusive communities from scratch. As lead editor on multiple textbook editions (Pack Prints I and II), I managed complex editorial projects from conception through publication.
This goes beyond theoretical knowledge about communication. It's hands-on experience with the exact challenges businesses face: taking complex expertise and making it accessible, maintaining consistent voice across different contributors, coordinating multiple stakeholders, and creating content that serves multiple purposes simultaneously.
Most importantly, I know the difference between communication that performs expertise and communication that demonstrates it.
From Educational Transformation to Business Transformation
Here's my core belief: every person who walks into a room is looking for tools to transform their circumstances. This applies whether that room is a classroom or a boardroom.
In academia, I built support systems that actually worked. When I established Arkansas State's online writing center, I created programs that worked within each department's existing culture while maintaining rigorous standards. The result? 300% growth in year one because students actually used what we built.
For STEM doctoral candidates struggling with dissertation writing, I developed ways to honor their technical expertise while helping them explain complex ideas clearly. For international students, I created support systems that respected their linguistic backgrounds while building academic writing skills. For first-generation college students, I designed programs that acknowledged their strengths while providing tools for institutional navigation.
Each program required the same fundamental approach: deep listening to understand actual needs (not assumptions), building systems robust enough to scale, and maintaining authenticity throughout growth. When I secured that $350,000 NSF grant, it wasn't because I wrote impressive proposals—it was because I could demonstrate measurable outcomes in programs that actually worked.
The same principles apply in business consulting. Instead of generic "brand voice" work, I help you identify what you actually know that others don't, then build communication systems that showcase that expertise consistently across contexts. Whether you're writing to investors, speaking at conferences, or posting on LinkedIn, the voice remains authentically yours while adapting to each platform's requirements.
The Expertise-First Approach
Generic communication is what happens when organizations don't trust their own expertise, or when they're trying to hide the fact that they don't have any. Bleached-out corporate speak—the kind that hides behind stock photography and senseless jargon—is designed to obscure rather than illuminate.
I help you build communication that trusts what you know and positions it exactly where it can create the most impact. Because your best clients aren't looking for safe and forgettable. They're looking for someone who genuinely understands their problem and has the expertise to solve it.
The market rewards authentic expertise delivered with precision. While others chase trends and buzzwords, we build communication systems around what you genuinely know and who genuinely needs it. The result is work that feels like you and gets results that matter.
What Sets This Apart
Real Academic Credentials: PhD-level understanding of how communication actually works, not just how we think it should work.
Proven Track Record: $365K+ in secured funding, 300% platform growth, 7 years of building scalable systems in higher education.
Professional Editing & Design Services: Lead editor on multiple textbook editions (Pack Prints series), managing complex editorial projects from conception through publication. I provide comprehensive editing services—from developmental editing that strengthens your core arguments to copy editing that ensures professional polish. Additionally, I offer graphic design services to create cohesive visual identities that support your content strategy. Whether you need a grant proposal that actually gets funded, marketing materials that reflect your expertise, or visual branding that feels authentically you, I understand the difference between work that sounds impressive and work that actually delivers results.
Systems Thinking: I create frameworks that grow with you while maintaining quality, drawing from experience building educational programs that serve thousands while preserving individual attention.
Cross-Platform Integration: Whether you're writing grants, creating content, or presenting to clients, I help you maintain consistent voice and message across all contexts.
Current Focus
I'm completing a book manuscript that critiques neoliberal influences on higher education while proposing actionable alternatives. This work directly informs my consulting approach: I help businesses resist commodification and generic messaging while building sustainable competitive advantages through authentic expertise.
In a moment when everyone sounds the same and AI can replicate surface-level content, the businesses that thrive will be those that can demonstrate genuine knowledge and authentic voice. That's exactly what my academic training taught me to identify, develop, and scale.
Ready to build communication systems that actually reflect who you are and get results that matter?

"Teaching writing is teaching thinking. Teaching thinking is teaching liberation. And teaching liberation is the most important work I can imagine doing."
The same principle applies in business: helping you find and use your authentic voice isn't just about marketing. It's about building something sustainable that reflects your actual expertise and values.
