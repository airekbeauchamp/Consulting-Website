Airek Beauchamp Consulting | Authentic Communication for Real Situations
Real Voices for People Doing Real Things
Because the world has enough people who sound like LinkedIn had a baby with a press release
I give your personal, granular voice a lossless megaphone so it translates accurately across audiences and media. For makers and doers who are tired of sounding like they're reading from the same script as everyone else.

What I Do
Seven years in higher education taught me something most consultants miss: you can't content-calendar your way to credibility. While everyone else is prompt-engineering their personality, I help real humans communicate like real humans.
I've convinced committees to cough up $365,668 for projects that mattered by understanding a simple truth: people fund vision, not vocabulary. They pay for expertise that sounds like it came from someone who's done the thing, not from someone who googled "grant writing templates" at 2 AM.
Your Voice, Just Louder
I give your expertise a lossless megaphone. Whether you're writing grants, posting online, or speaking to a room, we develop language that sounds like you on your best day. Yes, we'll hit the SEO keywords and ATS requirements—but wrapped in sentences humans want to read.
Money for Things That Matter
Grant writing for people who hate grant writing. I translate your vision into funder-speak without losing what makes it yours. We know the secret handshakes and required phrases, but we use them to support your real ideas, not replace them.
Everything Talks to Everything Else
Your newsletter shouldn't fight your website. Your talks should feed your writing. Your social posts should support your services. I build communication ecosystems where each piece strengthens the others—integrated by design, not duct tape.
Systems That Work When You're Sleeping
Documentation for humans, not robots. I create processes your team will follow and templates that don't sound like templates. Because the best system is the one people use, not the one gathering dust in your shared drive.

The Anti-Generic Approach
I help makers and doers make their voices seen and their doings heard. I give your personal, granular voice a lossless megaphone so it can translate accurately across audiences and media. My approach draws from a fundamental principle in rhetoric: the most innovative, persuasive arguments identify a gap (in the research, in the market, in the conventional approach) and work from there.
That's exactly how I work with clients. We excavate the gaps everyone's too busy "optimizing" to notice: Where are people craving actual conversation but getting demographic targeting instead? I believe real communication happens between subjects—human to human—not between a brand and a consumer profile. That's the mysterious ground beneath our feet that everyone ignores while they're busy "disrupting" calendars.
We're drowning in content and starving for meaning. People want to hear from humans who sound like humans—integrity, honesty, and all the weird specifics that make you real. They want someone who'll admit that the hardest problems (Why does this team actually work? What makes people trust each other? How do we say what we mean?) require more than another analytics dashboard.
Your authentic expertise deserves better than subject-object manipulation tactics. We position you for real conversations with real people about real challenges. Maybe that's sharing your bicycle-wonkery from childhood, or helping someone understand how the terroir of the Côtes-du-Rhône translates into their favorite vintage. The quirky specifics that make you irreplaceable. Because when you treat your audience as thinking subjects rather than consuming objects, something magical happens: they actually listen.
Real Expertise Over Generic Polish
Your knowledge and experience are your differentiators. I help you showcase what you actually know instead of hiding behind stock photography and generic messaging.
Systems That Scale
One-off tactics don't build businesses. I create communication frameworks that grow with you while maintaining quality and authenticity.
Platform Integration
Your content should work together, not compete with itself. I help you build ecosystems where every piece reinforces your expertise.

Things That Happened
Numbers are just numbers until they become stories. Here are some stories disguised as statistics:
$365,668 - Including $350K from NSF to teach STEM students how to write like scientists who can explain things
300% - Growth in digital writing center usage when we built it for how students work
7 Years - Building writing centers that helped everyone from first-year engineers to international PhD candidates
15+ People - Team members I trained who discovered they could write like themselves and still get promoted
The NSF grant came from federal scientists who understood that STEM students needed more than templates—they needed to understand how their disciplines communicate. The writing centers started face-to-face, went online, and helped thousands of students find their academic voices in their second (or third, or fourth) language. Those 15 people I trained and managed are out there right now, teaching others that good writing sounds like a human wrote it, whatever language they started in.

Refugee from the Ivory Tower
I spent seven years in higher education thinking I'd change the system from within. Spoiler: neoliberal creep is busy sucking all the education out of higher ed, and it's winning. But those years taught me something valuable: how to translate between worlds without losing what matters in translation.
Now I help people who make things communicate about the things they make. Not "leverage synergies" or "activate stakeholders"—just explain what you do to people who might care about it. Revolutionary concept, apparently.
I've written everything from federal grant applications to viral blog posts, built communication systems for research centers, and taught graduate students that academic writing doesn't have to sound like it was composed by a committee of thesauruses. Along the way, I discovered that the best communication happens when you stop trying to sound smart and start trying to be understood.
When I'm not helping clients find their voices, you'll find me thinking too hard about how grammar situates subjects, how to ethically keep the bunnies out of the green beans in the garden, and watching Taskmaster reruns.
