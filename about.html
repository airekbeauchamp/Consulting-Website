                <p>After completing my doctorate in writing studies and sound studies at SUNY Binghamton in 2016, I spent seven years as Assistant Professor and Director of Writing Support Innovations at Arkansas State University. During this time, I applied communication theory at scale, building programs that delivered measurable outcomes.</p>
                <p>I secured <span class="highlight">$365,668 in competitive funding</span> (including a $350,000 NSF grant) by understanding what funders actually want to see versus what academics think they want to hear. I grew online programs by <span class="highlight">300% in their first year</span> by building systems that worked at scale, not just on paper.</p>

                    <p>My scholarly work examines how marginalized communities use voice and sound to navigate systems, claim authority, and resist being ignored. This isn't abstract theory—it's directly applicable intelligence about how authentic communication cuts through noise and commands attention.</p>

                    <h3>Building Systems That Work</h3>
                    <p>In academia, I built support systems that actually worked. When I established Arkansas State's online writing center, I created programs that worked within each department's existing culture while maintaining rigorous standards. The result? 300% growth in year one because students actually used what we built.</p>

                    <h3>Tailored Solutions</h3>
                    <p>For STEM doctoral candidates struggling with dissertation writing, I developed ways to honor their technical expertise while helping them explain complex ideas clearly. For international students, I created support systems that respected their linguistic backgrounds while building academic writing skills. For first-generation college students, I designed programs that acknowledged their strengths while providing tools for institutional navigation.</p>

                    <p>Each program required the same fundamental approach: deep listening to understand actual needs (not assumptions), building systems robust enough to scale, and maintaining authenticity throughout growth. When I secured that $350,000 NSF grant, it wasn't because I wrote impressive proposals—it was because I could demonstrate measurable outcomes in programs that actually worked.</p>

            <div class="intro">
                <p>The same principles apply in business consulting. Instead of generic "brand voice" work, I help you identify what you actually know that others don't, then build communication systems that showcase that expertise consistently across contexts. Whether you're writing to investors, speaking at conferences, or posting on LinkedIn, the voice remains authentically yours while adapting to each platform's requirements.</p>

            <div class="intro">
                <p>Generic communication is what happens when organizations don't trust their own expertise, or when they're trying to hide the fact that they don't have any. Bleached-out corporate speak—the kind that hides behind stock photography and senseless jargon—is designed to obscure rather than illuminate.</p>
                
                <p>I help you build communication that trusts what you know and positions it exactly where it can create the most impact. Because your best clients aren't looking for safe and forgettable. They're looking for someone who genuinely understands their problem and has the expertise to solve it.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The market rewards authentic expertise delivered with precision.</strong> While others chase trends and buzzwords, we build communication systems around what you genuinely know and who genuinely needs it. The result is work that feels like you and gets results that matter.</p>
