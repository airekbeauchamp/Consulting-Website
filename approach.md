            The Anti-Generic Approach
Why Most Communication Consulting Fails
Stumble into any LinkedIn feed or business conference, and you'll hear the same recycled advice: "Be authentic! Tell your story! Build your personal brand!" Meanwhile, everyone following this advice sounds exactly the same—like they were trained by the same AI bot that learned communication from the horrifyingly bland child of sunbleached Successories posters and books about the Golden Parachute.
The problem isn't tactical. It's not that people need another content calendar template or "brand voice worksheet." The problem is strategic: most communication consulting treats expertise like a commodity that can be packaged, branded, and optimized using universal frameworks.
But genuine expertise isn't generic. It can't be templatized. And it definitely can't be faked.
I don't help people become bland, interchangeable "thought leaders." I help them figure out what they're good at, what gaps they fill, to find the people who need exactly what they can offer, and build communication systems that demonstrate real knowledge rather than performing it.
The Scholar-Practitioner Difference
Most communication consultants come from one of two backgrounds: academic theory with no real-world application, or business experience with no intellectual depth. I bring both.
Academic Foundation That Actually Applies
My PhD in writing studies and sound studies wasn't called to life in the rarified air of The Tower. It's the product of hands-on research into how marginalized communities use voice and sound to navigate systems, claim authority, and resist being ignored. I don't blow smoke signals. What I do is directly applicable intelligence about how authentic communication cuts through noise and commands attention.
As Editor-at-large for Sounding Out! and lead editor on multiple textbook editions, I've managed the exact challenges businesses face: taking complex expertise and making it accessible, maintaining consistent voice across different contributors, coordinating multiple stakeholders, and creating content that serves multiple purposes simultaneously.
Proven Business Results
Seven years building and scaling communication programs in higher education taught me that systems beat scattered tactics every time. I secured $365,668 in competitive funding by writing impressive proposals that demonstrate an understanding of what funders actually want to see versus what applicants think they want to hear.
When I grew online programs by 300% in their first year, it wasn't through viral content or growth hacks. It was by building systems that worked at scale while maintaining quality and authenticity.
The same principles that create measurable outcomes in education create measurable outcomes in business: deep listening to understand actual needs, building systems robust enough to scale, and maintaining authenticity throughout growth.
Four Principles That Drive Everything
1. Real Expertise Over Generic Polish
The market is oversaturated with polished content that could be selling anything. What's rare—and what people pay premium prices for—is genuine expertise delivered with authentic voice.
Instead of asking: "How do we make this sound more professional?" I ask: "What do you actually know that others don't, and how do we showcase that knowledge consistently?"
Your differentiator isn't your brand colors or your LinkedIn banner. It's what you genuinely understand about solving problems that matter to specific people. Everything else is color theory and pop psychology, and I happen to speak those languages too.
2. Systems That Scale Without Losing Soul
One-off tactics don't build businesses. Neither do rigid systems that strip away everything interesting about how you actually think and work.
Instead of templates that make everyone sound the same: I create frameworks that grow with you while preserving what makes your expertise valuable. Whether you're writing to one person or one thousand, the voice remains authentically yours while adapting to each context's requirements.
Real example: When I helped establish Arkansas State's online writing center, I created embedded disciplinary programs that worked within each department's existing culture while maintaining rigorous standards. The result was 300% growth because students actually used what we built—it worked with how they naturally operated, not against it.
3. Platform Integration, Not Platform Optimization
Most consultants optimize for individual platforms: "Here's your LinkedIn strategy. Here's your email strategy. Here's your speaking strategy." But your audience doesn't live in silos, and neither should your communication.
Instead of competing with yourself across platforms: I help you build ecosystems where every piece reinforces your expertise. Your newsletter supports your speaking topics, which reinforce your client work, which feeds back into your thought leadership. One coherent demonstration of knowledge, adapted for different contexts.
The result: Compound growth rather than scattered effort. Your communication investments build on each other instead of competing for attention.
4. Demonstration Over Performance
There's a crucial difference between communication that performs expertise and communication that demonstrates it. Performance is about appearing knowledgeable. Demonstration is about actually being useful.
Performance sounds like: "As a thought leader in strategic communication, I believe authentic storytelling drives engagement..." Demonstration sounds like: "When I secured $350,000 in NSF funding, the key wasn't impressive language—it was proving measurable outcomes in programs that actually worked."
One creates the impression of expertise. The other provides evidence of it. Only one builds lasting business relationships.
How We Actually Work
First: Figure Out What You Actually Know
Before writing a single word or choosing a single platform, we dig into what you actually know. This isn't a questionnaire or brand audit template. It's a real conversation about real expertise:
What do you understand that others in your field miss?
Which problems have you solved that others just talk about?
What proof do you have of real expertise (results, not just credentials)?
Where does your genuine knowledge create the most value?
I prefer to work in person. I once read about a consultant who mentioned meeting a client face-to-face as if it were revolutionary. How can you represent someone's authentic voice when you've never heard them actually speak? How do you capture their expertise when you've never seen them in action? We need to meet, share the same air, have dinner, or lunch, cocktails or coffee. I need to see the space you inhabit, and how you move through it.
Second: Build Systems That Work Together
Based on what you actually know and what you're trying to build, we figure out how to make your communication work as a system instead of a collection of random tactics:
What are the core things you know that should show up everywhere?
Where does your knowledge create the most impact and attract the right people?
How do we set up ways to share that knowledge that don't eat your life?
How does each piece support the others instead of competing?
Third: Make It Actually Happen
Strategy without execution is expensive advice. But execution without strategy is just busy work:
Document your voice so other people can help without sounding like robots
Create workflows that produce good content without burning you out
Train your team to maintain quality and consistency
Track what actually drives business, not just likes and shares
Fourth: Keep It Growing Without Breaking It
Good communication systems evolve with your expertise and business goals:
Regular check-ins based on what's actually working for your business
Planning for growth that doesn't dilute what makes you valuable
Building team capacity while keeping your voice authentic
Adapting to changes while preserving what makes you different
What This Actually Looks Like
For the Architecture Consultant
Instead of generic "design tips" content, we position you as the architect who actually understands spatial psychology and building performance. Your furniture collection becomes evidence of curatorial expertise. Your newsletter connects design principles to business outcomes. Your speaking topics demonstrate knowledge that amateur flippers can't fake.
Result: Premium pricing because people trust your credibility, not just your inventory.
For the Business Strategy Expert
Instead of recycled LinkedIn advice about "authenticity," we showcase the specific frameworks you've developed through actual client work. Your case studies become teaching tools. Your content demonstrates problem-solving methodology, not just theoretical knowledge.
Result: Ideal clients seek you out because they need what you specifically know how to do.
For the Grant Writing Specialist
Instead of generic "funding tips," we highlight your understanding of what different funders actually prioritize. Your success stories become credibility markers. Your content educates while demonstrating deep knowledge of evaluation criteria and decision-making processes.
Result: Organizations choose you because they see evidence of results, not just promises.
Why This Works When Others Don't
It's Based on How People Actually Make Decisions
People don't hire consultants because of impressive websites or viral LinkedIn posts. They hire based on evidence of relevant expertise applied to problems they actually have. Everything we build provides that evidence.
It Leverages Your Natural Strengths
Instead of teaching you to perform like someone else, we identify what you naturally do well and build systems that amplify those capabilities. Less energy wasted on performance, more impact from genuine expertise.
It Creates Sustainable Competitive Advantage
Generic communication can be replicated by anyone with decent writing skills and a subscription to the right tools. Authentic expertise backed by proven results can't be faked or automated. It compounds over time while generic approaches fade.
It Builds Business Value, Not Just Visibility
Visibility without credibility is just noise. We build communication systems that don't just get attention—they attract the right attention from people who value what you specifically know and can afford what you actually charge.
The Anti-Generic Promise
While others chase trends and optimize for algorithms, we build communication around what you genuinely know and who genuinely needs it. While others help you sound like everyone else in your industry, we help you sound like yourself—but clearer, more strategic, and more focused on what actually drives business results.
The market rewards authentic expertise delivered with precision and consistency. That's exactly what this approach creates, and that's why it works when generic frameworks don't.
Ready to build communication systems that actually reflect who you are and get results that matter?
The first step is understanding what you genuinely know that others don't. From there, we build everything else.
